      "Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is a specialized XML dialect used for creating and managing conversational agents or chatbots. Developed by Richard Wallace in the mid-1990s, AIML enables the construction of natural language processing (NLP) systems capable of understanding and responding to human inputs. AIML files consist of various patterns and templates, where patterns represent the possible user inputs and templates define the corresponding bot responses. This structure allows developers to design complex dialogue systems with relative ease by leveraging pattern matching techniques. AIML-powered chatbots have been widely adopted in customer service, virtual assistants, and educational tools, demonstrating significant versatility and effectiveness in automating interactive communication tasks.
